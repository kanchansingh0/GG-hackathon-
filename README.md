# RTL Timing Violation Predictor

## Overview
An AI-based approach to predict timing violations in RTL designs by analyzing combinational complexity and logic depth of signals before synthesis, reducing design iteration time and improving RTL code quality.

## Problem Statement
Timing analysis in complex IP/SoC design traditionally requires synthesis, which is time-consuming. This project predicts combinational logic depth from RTL code to identify potential timing violations during the RTL design phase.

## Implemented Approaches

### 1. Machine Learning Models

#### Primary Model: Random Forest Regressor
- Implementation: sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor
- Configuration:
  python
  params = {
      'n_estimators': 200,
      'max_depth': 15,
      'min_samples_split': 5,
      'min_samples_leaf': 2
  }
  
- Advantages:
  - Handles non-linear relationships in timing paths
  - Provides feature importance analysis
  - Robust to overfitting

### 2. Feature Engineering

1. *Fan-in Count* (1-10 gates)
   - Measures input gate connections
   - Impacts combinational depth

2. *Fan-out Count* (1-8 outputs)
   - Measures output connections
   - Affects signal propagation

3. *Logic Depth* (1-15 levels)
   - Represents gate levels in path
   - Key timing violation indicator

4. *Operation Complexity* (0-1 normalized)
   - Complexity score of operations
   - Weighted impact on timing

5. *Path Length* (0-1 normalized)
   - Physical path characteristics
   - Routing complexity measure

### 3. Evaluation Metrics

#### Implemented Metrics
1. *Accuracy Metrics*
   - RÂ² Score
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

2. *Classification Metrics*
   - Binary accuracy (threshold-based)
   - Confusion matrix
   - Precision and recall

### 4. Visualization Methods

1. *Confusion Matrix*
   - Uses seaborn heatmap
